# Encryption_Decryption
HyperSkill Project #8

 This was the first attempt at a Strategy pattern solution along with …

…a Command pattern and a Singleton pattern at a command prompt based program. This program is a simple exercise in attempting encryption based off either a Caesar shift or an ASCII shift. The Strategy pattern helps decide in a decision tree of what possible options are available as well as create a structure to add more functionality (different/more encryption implementations) without affecting the client code (main).
